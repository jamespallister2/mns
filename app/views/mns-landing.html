        const specification = {"openapi":"3.0.0","info":{"title":"Multicast Notification Service (MNS) - REST API","version":"v1.0.243-alpha","description":"## Overview\n![MNS High-level Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/multicast-notification-service/master/assets/images/MNSOverview2.svg)\n\nUse this API to publish or and subscribe to healthcare-related events. This API is currently only live with patient-related event. However, it is intended as a robust service that could support many types of future event e.g. changes related to healthcare organisations or staff.\n\nThe events do not contain clinical information; they simply describe what type of event occurred to whom/what and where. A pointer is provided to enable retrieval of the further event details.\n\nThis API is intended for NHS England internal product teams as a means of decoupling systems by providing access to streams of lightweight data from various sources without the need for direct integration.\n\nYou can:\n  - Publish events.\n  - Subscribe to events based on event type and optional corresponding criteria filter.\n\nAvailable and in development events can be viewed visiting the [NHS API and integration catalogue](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue) and filtering on `MNS`.\n\nData flow:\n  1. An event occurs on a event publishers system. The this system notifies MNS event occurring, along with a pointer to be used for retrieval of further event details.\n  2. MNS validates that the event conforms to the accepted schema and sends it another component to handle subscription matching and onward delivery.\n  3. MNS matches the signal against subscribing organisations and delivers it to their specified destinations, for example an AWS Kinesis Firehose.\n  4. Subscribers can use the details forwarded to them to retrieve further details of the event\n\n## Who can use this API\nThis API can only currently be used by internal NHS England services. Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. You\nmust do this before you can go live (see [Onboarding](#overview--onboarding) below).\n\nNote: during beta, this API will only be used by NHS England product teams with a valid use case.\n## Related APIs\nThe following API also provides access to healthcare-related events:\n  - [National Events Management Service - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/national-events-management-service-fhir \"National\n  Events Management Service - FHIR API\") - the difference is that the payloads MNS delivers will be event signals: lightweight events that do not contain any clinical information, they 'signal' a state has changed. NEMS delivers events to external subscriber systems whereas MNS is intended only for use by internal NHS England product teams. The two systems will be complementary.\n## API status and roadmap\nThis API is [in production (beta)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).\n\nYou can comment, upvote and view progress on our [roadmap](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/suggestions/440034/multicast-notification-service-event-management-api).\n## Service level\nThis API is a bronze service, meaning it is operational and supported only during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.\n\nFor more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).\n## Technology\nThis API is a [REST-based](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest) [publish-subscribe](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/introduction-to-healthcare-technology/integration-and-apis#publish-subscribe-events) API.\n\nThe signal structure is based on the recommendations of the [Cloud Events specification.](https://cloudevents.io/)\n## Network access\nThis API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).\n\nFor more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).\n## Security and authorisation\n\nThis API has one access mode:\n- application-restricted access\n\n### Application-restricted access\nUse this access mode if you need to publish an event from your system.\n\nThis access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.\n\nThe end user could be:\n* a healthcare worker - for example they record an event in an application and that application then publishes to MNS\n* a patient - for example they make a change to their record in a patient-facing application and that application then publishes to MNS\n* not present at all - for example as part of a back end process where events from an NHS England product or system are generated\n\nIn the above cases you must ensure the users are authenticated and suitably authorised locally\n\nTo use this access mode, use the following security pattern:\n* [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)\n\n## Environments and testing\n\n| Environment       | Base URL                                                               |\n| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/multicast-notification-service`    |\n| Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/multicast-notification-service`        |\n| Ref Environment   | `https://ref.api.service.nhs.uk/multicast-notification-service`        |\n| Production        | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/multicast-notification-service`            |\n\n### Sandbox testing\nOur [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):\n* is for early developer testing\n* only covers a limited set of scenarios\n* is stateless, so does not actually persist any updates\n* is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation\n\nFor details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.\n\nAlternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection (simply download the file from the link and import it into Postman):\n\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://github.com/NHSDigital/multicast-notification-service/blob/master/postman/sandbox/Multicast_Notification_Sandbox.postman_collection.json)\n## Onboarding\nDuring the planned private beta this service will only be available to NHS England product teams. The onboarding process is in development and we will be\nimproving it iteratively as we gather feedback from the first set of users.\n\n## Errors\nWe use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:\n\n* 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action\n* 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application\n* 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server\n\nErrors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.\n\n## Open source\nYou might find the following [open source](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#open-source) resources useful:\n\n| Resource                  | Description                                                          | Links                                                                       |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| MNS API                   | Source code for the API proxy, sandbox and specification.            | [GitHub repo](https://github.com/NHSDigital/multicast-notification-service) |\n| FHIR libraries and SDKs   | Various open source libraries for integrating with FHIR APIs.        | [FHIR libraries and SDKs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) |\n\nWe currently don't have any open source client libraries or sample code for this API.

For example, for [PDS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service) events it includes elements such as the family name and date of birth which are primarily for verification. Users must be cautious not to use such metadata to modify a patient's demographic details. Instead, if updates are necessary, users should conduct a full PDS retrieval to ensure accuracy and completeness in their workflows.\n  - Data: The inclusion of the data field might vary. Its presence is subject to agreements between the MNS team and the originating system. While the structure of the data might differ across various systems and scenarios, it's a general preference to have a pointer included.

You can view details of the available signals on our [Signal Catalogue page](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/multicast-notification-service/signal-catalogue).\n\n### Subscription filtering\nYou can filter the signals you want to receive using the `criteria` field in the payload. As a minimum, you must specify the event type. For example, if you provide `eventType=pds-change-of-gp-1`\nthis will mean that you receive all PDS Change of GP events. Depending on the event, additional filters are available, for example you can filter by `generalpractitioner`,`registrationencountercode` or `supplierNACS` for `gpreg-change-gp-req-1` event.\nWe are working with publishers and subscribers during private beta to identify any other useful filters for existing and future event types.\n\nFor further information refer to the payload schema below.\n\n### Subscription delivery\nYou can specify the endpoint you want signals delivered to using the `channel.endpoint` field in the payload. MNS currently only supports delivery to [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) endpoints and\n[MESH](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-mesh) mailboxes. We are working with users during private beta to identify other potential delivery endpoints.\nThere may be further delivery endpoints available in future.\n\nYou can make suggestions using [feature upvote](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com).\n\n#### SQS Delivery\nBefore signals can be delivered to your SQS queue, you will need to complete some configuration steps during onboarding e.g. policy and encryption setup. When you make a create subscription request, you must provide your\nfull SQS ARN.\n\n#### MESH Delivery\nYou will need to provide the ID of your MESH mailbox during onboarding. If you have already completed [MESH onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-api#overview--end-to-end-process-to-integrate-with-mesh-api)\nthen no further steps will be required aside from calling the subscriptions API.
